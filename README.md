# guided-journal-frontend

Guided Journal is a single-page application (SPA) which allows the user to add and edit journal entries through built-in guided prompts. Created with a JS front end and Rails API for the backend. 

To run this application clone this repository down to your local device along with the Rails backend (https://github.com/rnkwilliams/guided-journal-api). While in the Rails backend run rails s to start the server. You can then open the index page in a browser and run the application like normal.

Enjoy!
